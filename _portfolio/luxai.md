## What is it?
During my 3rd year at CentraleSupélec, I participated to LuxAI Season 3, a competition hosted by Kaggle and featured at NeurIPS. 

The competition was about designing agents for playing a challenging strategy game. The approach of my team involved Deep reinforcement Learning, and used a single PPO agent, and a implementation in "full-JAX" fashion.
