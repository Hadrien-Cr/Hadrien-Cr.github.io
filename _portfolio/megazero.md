## What is it?
During my 3rd year at CentraleSupélec, I developed MegaZero, an extension of AlphaZero to multi-action games (ie games where you take multiple actions in each turn). My approach involved combining AlphaZero training ideas with Evolutionary MCTS. I benchmarked my code on Strands and a toy-game called Connect4d.
