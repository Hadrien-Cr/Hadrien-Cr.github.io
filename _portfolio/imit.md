## What is it?
During my 3rd year at CentraleSupélec, I worked with Elian Mangin, in collaboration with the laboratory MICS and CEA List. We worked on reconstructing interaction models from the traces that are obtained by execution such models. Our approach is the very first data-driven work ever on the topic, and it involves Seqence-to-Sequence models, trained on curated synthetic data. We are in the process of writing a conference paper.
